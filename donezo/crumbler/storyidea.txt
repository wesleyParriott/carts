COW OH NO! 

You've somehow gotten yourself into the cookie dimension with only 3 gallons of fresh milk left in your udder. 
I've played Arkanoid so I know the only way out is to shoot a milk ball to crumble all the cookies. This will surely
appease the all powerful cookie based gods and allow you passage back into your farm-based universe. 

I, the player, do have power to help guide you through this cookie conundrum with the power of my laptop's keyboard and
the mighty Pico-8 Fantasy Console! 

Don't fear lil buddy. We'll get you through this.
