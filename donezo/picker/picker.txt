While picker isn't a very intersting game I feel like it was a success because it was the first time I did a full sprite
sheet with pico8, and it was my first successful upload to the bbs.

There's a couple things I learned during the process:
The way I created the entites into one big table and then just had
each have a draw and update function seems pretty easy to maintain and obvious. 
We don't need to have a table of states and types as if their were enums. Strings are fine to use in Lua because string
compares are fast enough.
If you have a spritesheet you have to make sure that a bigger sprite doesn't cross page boundries
